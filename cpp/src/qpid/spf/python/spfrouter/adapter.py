  This module is responsible for managing the Adapter's key bindings (list of address-subject:next-hop).

  (i.e. topological keys for inter-router communication and mobile keys for end users).

  For each key-class, a mirror copy of what the adapter has is kept internally.  This allows changes to the
  routing tables to be efficiently communicated to the adapter in the form of table deltas.
